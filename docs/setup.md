# Setup

## Mac OS Setup

### 1. Install XCode Developer Tools

```
xcode-select --install
```

Note: You should not need the full [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).


### 2. Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS.

Please follow the installation instructions at http://brew.sh/

### 3. Install python, node.js, and npm

To install ``node-version-manager``, please follow:

https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script

Python may be required for working with some projects, though macOS has it built in. Installing node.js will provide you with the `node` and `npm` commands.

```
# brew install nvm;  # Note: nvm discourages installation by brew
nvm install 6.3.1;
nvm alias default 6.3.1;
```
